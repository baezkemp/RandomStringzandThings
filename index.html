        <h2>When crafty sisters join forces!</h2>
        <p> Random Stringz & Things was created when two crafty sisters joined forces in the pursuit of hobbies and entertainment... and maybe a little extra pocket change. Both involved in multiple crafts, the name of the duo had to somehow indicate the variety of products that could and would be involved while leaving room for expansion into new and asunyet charted hobbies.

        <p class = "center"> Random Stringz & Things was born. </p>
        <p>
        Originally focused on jewelry and yarncraft, it has since expanded to include sewing and embroidery as well.
        <br> <br> Stay tooned to see where it might go from here!

        <h2>With some string and a few other things, we can make magic!</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the transition from parts to a whole seems more like magic. 
            How a ball of yarn can turn into a scarf or a bit of thread and few bobbles can turn into a beautiful and unique piece of jewelry.</p>

        <p>While most crafts don't actually require many tools to do, collecting tools of trade can become a hobby of it's own.

        <br>I currently have two sewing machines, a serger, and an embroidery machine.
        </p>
        <p> However, every time I see a sewing machine that has fancy new features, or is old and a classic workhorse, I have to remind myself that two is enough.</p>
        <h2>Stringz</h2>
        <p>
            Stringz includes all creations using yarn or thread. 
            Though most often this means products created through kniting or crochet.

            Craft is defined as a skill used in making something. Everything from woodworking to baking can be considered crafts. Most crafts are required to better our lives, even if they have been taken over by industry and machines in large warehouses. Keeping the skills alive from one generation to the next will help us, not only to connect to our past, but to create for our future.
